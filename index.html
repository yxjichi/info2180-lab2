        <h2>Punctum</h2>
        <h4>November 5, 2021 • contributed by grll</h4>

        <img src="CatMarnellEase.jpg"
             alt="Photo depicting Author Cat Marnell"
             style="float: left; margin: 0 1rem 1rem 0; width: 250px; border-radius: 8px;">

        <p>
          For me, a picture reaches punctum with context. As such, most images that reach this
          state for me are seemingly basic for the uninitiated. This is, after all, a white girl
          poised for a selfie in what appears to be her bedroom. However, Cat is also a model of
          someone who has managed to tame her darkness and piece together the scattered shrapnel
          of a damaged personhood.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cat has gone through a great deal in terms of parental neglect, drug addiction, mental
          health issues, and more. In short, she has <em>Gone Through It</em>. Even so, she retains
          a doe-eyed kindness in her demeanor. She has found what truly suits her—fashion and
          beauty writing—and has made peace with her torment.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm still learning how to deal with my own torment, and in college I've had my share of
          ups and downs. But when I look at Cat in this picture, I feel hope that I too will
          someday make peace with the war in my mind and focus on the joys in my life. It reminds
          me that recovery doesn’t require my problems to disappear—if it did, I fear I'd never
          recover. My issues may disfigure me, but I can still pursue the cultivation of joy and
          happiness wherever they remain.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cat and I have lived very different lives and come from different backgrounds, but I
          find communion with her in our shared pursuit of recovered well-being. It's in this
          context that the image—among many others of Cat—achieves punctum for me. The energy of
          this image hasn’t left me since I first saw it, and I hope it never does.

        <h2>Excerpt from "Noone Owes Me an Adventure"</h2>
        <h4>October 17, 2021 • contributed by grll</h4>

        <img src="perf_blue.jpg"
             alt="Still from Satoshi Kon's 'Perfect Blue'"
             style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1rem 1rem; width: 250px; border-radius: 8px;">

        <p>
          Today I had a revelation regarding why I feel so personally wounded when I fail to form
          substantial friendships with people that I find interesting.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's like I want to crawl under everyone's skin and be known to them, but in reality a
          lot of people have their own plate full and don't really want me under their skin. It's
          entitled to presume that they would or should.
        </p>

        <p>
          The people I share this life with don't owe me their skin or an adventure. That's ok.
          I get it.
